## Story:

FEUPLings is an addictive 2D strategy puzzle game in which the user is tasked with helping the MEIC freshmen escape from FEUP's long corridor B. You'll face various obstacles, such as holes, walls and the final boss - a terrible monster, who jumps and spits fire! However, the freshmen have various powers, as they can jump and change directions. Can you help them in time?

## Instructions:

- 6 freshmen will appear in the middle of the FEUP's corridor B. The main goal is to help them leave the corridor in the expected time.

(- The monster spits fire and if a freshman gets hit by the flames, it will die).

- You can use the power-ups available on the interface: you can make a freshman jump, change direction or reduce its speed. The power-ups are limited, so you must use them wisely!

- There are 2 ways of using power-ups: you can you use on a single freshman, or you can create an area for one- if a freshman reaches that area, it will be affected by the respective power-up.

- If you can't make at least 1 freshman leave the corridor at time, you lose!

## Controls:

- Click on the left button of the mouse to select a freshman, or a power-up;
- Scroll the middle button of the mouse to alternate between the single and target mode.
