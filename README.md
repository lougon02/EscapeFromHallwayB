## Story:

FEUPlings is an addictive 2D strategy puzzle game in which the user is tasked with helping the MEIC freshmen escape from FEUP's long corridor B. You'll face various obstacles: the corridor's benches and heaters. However, the freshmen have various powers, as they can jump and change directions. Can you help them in time?

## Instructions:

- 6 freshmen will appear in the middle of the FEUP's corridor B. The main goal is to help them leave the corridor in the expected time.

- You can use the power-ups available on the interface: you can make a freshman jump, change direction or reduce its speed. The power-ups are limited, so you must use them wisely!

- If a freshman collides with an obstacle, it changes its directions.

- There are 2 ways of using power-ups: you can you use on a single freshman, or you can create an area for one- if a freshman reaches that area, it will be affected by the respective power-up.

- If you can't make at least 1 freshman leave the corridor at time, you lose!

## Controls:

- Click on the left button of the mouse to select a freshman, or a power-up;
- Scroll the middle button of the mouse to alternate between the single target and area mode.
